## Project's Name
Rently

## Description
ASP.NET MVC Application for registering and renting a movie. 

This is a project where I will always be working on. I plan to create a Web API in .Net Core and consume that from Asp.Net MVC app.
I will add Domain-driven design (DDD) approach to mitigate possible complexities that may appear in the project. I'm also applying SOLID principles as well as Clean Code principles in order to try always leave a code where anyone could easily understand. To ensure the proj has a good mature level, I'm going to implement TDD as well as Azure-based CI/CD pipelines to get my code always deployable.
